    "# Homework 5 - The Marvel Universe!\n",
    "\n",
    "Superheroes and abilities have always existed in the human imagination. Marvel has one of the largest superhero comic book franchises. Famous superheroes, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor, are among its cast, as are well-known superhero teams like the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Additionally, it has famous supervillains, including Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, and Thanos, in its stable. Most of Marvel's fictional characters function in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with many of their headquarters located in New York City. These comics are well-known today because of their use in movies. If you do not know who we are talking about, [give this link a look](https://www.marvel.com/explore) and learn more about the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, you and your team have decided to dive deep into Marvel's social network. Now, you will deal with graphs to determine relevant characteristics and highlights from the relations among those superheroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's hands-on this!\n",
    "\n",
    "# VERY VERY IMPORTANT!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. !!! Read the entire homework before coding anything!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. My solution it's not better than yours, and yours is not better than mine. In any data analysis task, there is not a unique way to solve a problem. For this reason, it is crucial (necessary and mandatory) that you describe any single decision you take and all the steps you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once performed any exercise, comments about the obtained results are mandatory. We are not always explicit about where to focus your comments, but we will always want brief sentences about your discoveries and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Homework, you will explore the Marvel Comics Universe, exploring relations between heroes and villains in the comics!\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Backend__: where you need to develop efficient algorithms that define the functionalities of the system\n",
    "- __Frontend__: where you provide visualization for queries entered by the user\n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT:__ The main functions for each functionality should be written from scratch in the backend part. Nevertheless, you can use the data structures provided by networkx (such as closeness_centrality, betweenness_centrality, pagerank, or any other function that can help you as an intermediate step for your main functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the visualization part, you can use any available function (networkx functions are highly recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you have to download the data, as always, from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network?select=hero-network.csv). Make sure you downloaded all files because we will work with them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the files contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __nodes.csv__ - Contains two columns (node, type), indicating the nodes' name and type (comic, hero).\n",
    "- __edges.csv__ - Contains two columns (hero, comic), indicating which comics the heroes appear in.\n",
    "- __hero-network.csv__ - Contains the network of heroes who have appeared together in the comics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we are going to build two different graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __First graph:__ Will be constructed using the data stored in the 'hero-network.csv' file, in which an edge between two heroes can be found if they have appeared in the same comic together. The number of edges between two heroes represents the number of times they have collaborated in different comics. The graph should be considered weighted and undirected. It is up to you to decide which metric to use to calculate the weights, but we anticipate that the cost will be lower for heroes with more collaborations. Please specify which metric you used to select the weights in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Second graph:__ The data in 'nodes.csv' and 'edges.csv' will be used to construct the second graph. The type of node (hero/comic) can be found in 'nodes.csv', and an edge between a hero node and a comic node can be found in 'edges.csv' when the hero has appeared in that specific comic. This graph is assumed to be undirected and unweighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, in the data science area, you can find some inconsistencies in the provided data. Therefore, some modifications should be made to the data to make it consistent across all of the datasets you have. To ensure consistency in the data, keep the following in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the heroes' names in 'hero-network.csv' are not found in 'edges.csv'. This inconsistency exists for the following reasons:\n",
    "- Some heroes' names in 'hero-netowrk.csv' have extra spaces at the end of their names compared to their names in 'edges.csv'.\n",
    "- Some heroes' names in 'hero-netowrk.csv' have an extra '/' at the end of their names compared to their names in 'edges.csv'.\n",
    "- The hero name 'SPIDER-MAN/PETER PARKER' in 'edges.csv' has been changed to 'SPIDER-MAN/PETER PAR' in 'hero-network.csv' due to a string length limit in 'hero-network.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some entries in the 'hero-network.csv' have the same hero in both columns. In the graph, these entries form a self-loop. Because a self-loop makes no sense in this network, you can safely remove those from the dataset.\n",

    "## 6. Algorithmic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex and Sarah have been together for two years, and Alex is now thinking about proposing to her. But, to surprise her, he wants to install an app on her phone that asks her if she will marry him at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to install the application secretly, he needs her phone's password, which he does not have. He knows her password is a __poly-line made up of vertical or horizontal line segments__. In a __3*3__ grid, each line segment connects the centres of two cells. Alex learned the direction of each line segment by looking at her hand while unlocking her phone. He didn't pay much attention to the length of each line segment, but he is sure that her phone's operating system __does not allow__ the poly-line __to intersect with itself even at one point.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex wants to distract Sarah's attention long enough to test all possible patterns based on the directions of the line segments he has learned. Therefore, he needs you to assist him in calculating how many possible patterns he has to try based on those directions to estimate how much time he needs to check all of those possibilities. Given that the line segments were directed right, down, left, and up, the following figure depicts __two valid__ and __one invalid__ (as the poly-lines should not intersect even in one point) patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Input:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is a __single string__ that shows the direction of the segment lines and contains only the characters R, L, U, and D, which correspond to the Right, Left, Up, and Down directions. The string's maximum length is __10__. It is also guaranteed that two consecutive characters will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ouput:__\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to see only __1 number__ in the output, corresponding to the number of different patterns that can be generated based on the line segments Alex learned. In some cases, this number __may be 0__, indicating that no patterns can be generated using the learned line segments.\n",
